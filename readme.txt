An awesome calendar that just works! Shows the upcoming holidays and/or your own events.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you a widget that shows the upcoming holidays.

The data is loaded from a webservice within www.theholidaycalendar.com.

This happens in an a-sync manner so your website will not slow down as a result of this. Example request: http://www.theholidaycalendar.com/handlers/pluginData.ashx?pluginVersion=1.0&amountOfHolidays=3&fromDate=2014-06-23 Parameters: pluginVersion = version of the installed plugin, amountOfHolidays = number of holidays to fetch, fromDate = fetch only holidays after this date.

No private data will ever be sent to this webservice beside some minor diagnostic information (i.e. website domain, plugin version, install date etc.)

== Installation ==
1. Upload `the-holiday-calendar` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Appearance -> Widgets and add our widget to your website
4. Add your own events through the event page in the admin screen
