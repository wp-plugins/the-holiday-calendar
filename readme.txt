*NEW!* An awesome calendar plugin that just works! Shows the upcoming holidays and/or your own events.

== Description ==

This plugin comes as a widget that shows your upcoming events. If you want you can automatically import the holidays from http://www.theholidaycalendar.com.

Two views are available: calendar view and list view.

If you choose to import the holidays they are fetched from a webservice. This happens asynchronous so your website will not get slow.

For more information about the webservice visit: http://www.mva7.nl/the-holiday-calendar-webservice-manual.html

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Appearance -> Widgets and add our widget to your website
4. Add your own events through the event page in the admin screen
